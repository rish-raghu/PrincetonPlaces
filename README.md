#### Overview
Our collaborative campus map is intended to 1) enable anyone who would like to explore campus but is unable to do so physically for any reason (students learning virtually, prospective students) to explore it through the eyes of members of the Princeton community, and 2) allow Princetonians an opportunity to share memorable locations on campus that helped shape their experience. Authenticated users can upload photos to the web app and pin them to the associated location, as well as add a description if they wish. Anyone can explore campus by clicking on existing pins to view a picture and description. Hopefully this app will allow members of the Princeton community to share their “insider knowledge” of lesser known locations they found fun or valuable while on campus.
